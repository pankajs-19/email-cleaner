Improvements:
    - Extract body is recursive - check if it is efficient and necessary - is there another way?

    - Currently email body is fetched by calling the get-body api. Cache bodies to avoid repeat API calls.

    - make the date selceter as a single dropdown and can select from and end date together in one as a tube.


A. The "Inbox Cleanup"
    Instead of just showing a list, add logic to help the user decide what to delete.

    Frequency Score: Show how many emails that specific sender has sent in the last 30 days.

    "Last Read" Detection: If you can see which emails have been "opened" vs "unread," you can flag 
    senders where the user has a 0% open rate.

    One-Click Bulk Delete: Once they click unsubscribe, offer a button to "Delete all 452 previous emails 
    from this sender" to instantly free up storage.

B. The "Screener" or "Auto-Trash"
    If an unsubscribe link is broken (which happens often with spam), provide a "Shield" feature.

    The Logic: If the user clicks "Block" in your app, your script creates a Filter (using the Gmail API) that automatically 
    sends all future emails from that address straight to the Trash.

C. Dashboard & Analytics
    Storage Savings: Show a counter of how much space (in MB/GB) was saved by deleting the newsletters found.

    Category View: Group senders by type (e.g., "Shopping," "Social Media," "News") using simple keyword matching in the sender's domain.
